CPS3962 Term Project

Car Craigslist is an application made entirely for educational purposes to fulfill a project assignment at Kean University. Its design is based upon the following business model:

Our goal as a business is to provide people in the market looking to sell or buy vehicles a service which allows sellers to advertise their vehicle, and which allows buyers to view filtered options for vehicles that fit the specifications that they are looking for, while also facilitating seamless transactions from seller to buyer. This will be done by creating an online marketplace where car sellers and car buyers can interact and facilitate transactions through.
